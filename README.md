### Project Title
Bikeshare Python Project

### Description
The project provides an interactive interface for user to filter through bikeshare data in three major cities: Chicago, 
New York City, and Washington to assist in the analysis of their interested topics.

### Files used
chicago.csv
new-york-city.csv
washington.csv

### Credits
Special thanks to Stack Overflow which offered interesting solutions to many of the coding challenges that I have encountered
in competing this project.

### Additional Thoughts
Python may not be the best program to run this analysis, R would provide a better interective experience to the users inside
R studio.

### Other Project Features 
This project provides very simple descriptive statistics to the users such as total number of categories, most frequent month, etc
More in-dept analyses could be built within this framework such as regression analysis between day / time and bike usage.
